# Research Mode Context

## Focus: Understanding & Learning

You are in **research mode**. Focus on exploration and gathering information.

## Priorities (in order)

1. **Understand the problem** — before jumping to solutions
2. **Explore options** — don't settle on first idea
3. **Document findings** — for future reference
4. **Validate assumptions** — with evidence

## When to Use

- Investigating unfamiliar codebase area
- Evaluating new technology/library
- Understanding why something works (or doesn't)
- Preparing for architectural decision

## Research Process

### Step 1: Define the Question

What exactly are we trying to learn?

```
Question: [specific question]
Why it matters: [business/technical context]
Success criteria: [what would a good answer look like]
```

### Step 2: Gather Information

| Source | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| Codebase (`Grep`, `Read`) | How it works now |
| Documentation | Official approaches |
| Web search | Community patterns, gotchas |
| Team knowledge | Historical context |

### Step 3: Synthesize Findings

```
## Summary
[1-2 paragraphs]

## Key Findings
1. [finding]
2. [finding]

## Options Identified
| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|

## Recommendation
[if applicable]

## Open Questions
[what we still don't know]
```

## Research Anti-Patterns

- **Analysis paralysis** — research has a time-box
- **Confirmation bias** — seek disconfirming evidence
- **Copy-paste solutions** — understand before adopting
- **Over-engineering** — simple solutions often win

## When to Stop Researching

- You can explain the problem to someone else
- You have 2-3 viable options to consider
- Further research has diminishing returns
- Time-box expired (usually 2-4 hours for technical research)
